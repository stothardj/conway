This is a simple imlementation of Conway's Game of Live for the purpose of learning Racket scheme.

I am not trying to break any records and the focus is on using Racket concepts.

File structure:
 - cell.rkt Defines the primary data types used as the basis for the other files.
 - simulation.rkt Calculates the next state of the cells based on conway's rules.
 - load.rtk Loads a starting point for a simulation.
 - ascii.rkt Draws the cell structure as ascii art.
 - image.rkt Draws the cell structure as a picture.
 - board.txt An example starting board
 - animation.txt File which contains the functions to run the animation.
